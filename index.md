Tiny Titan is a $1,000 classroom supercomputer designed to teach aspiring scientists the basics of parallel computing. Unlike modern desktops and laptops that hide parallelism from the user, Tiny Titan makes parallel concepts explicit.

## Software

Tiny Titan features interactive simulations that showcase the basic concepts of parallel computing. An Xbox controller allows students to explore load-balancing and communication by directing the simulation in real-time. Each of these simulations are freely available on our [GitHub](https://github.com/tinytitan).

## Build your Own

You can build and program your own Tiny Titan using the plans and parts lists available here:
