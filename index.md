Tiny Titan is a sub-$1,000 classroom supercomputer designed to teach aspiring scientists the basics of parallel computing. Unlike modern desktops and laptops that hide parallelism from the user, Tiny Titan makes parallel concepts explicit.

## Software

Tiny Titan features interactive simulations that showcase the basic concepts of parallel computing. An Xbox controller allows students to explore load-balancing and communication by directing the simulation in real-time. Each of these simulations are frely available on our [GitHub](https://github.com/tinytitan). 

## Build your Own

You can build and program your own Tiny Titan using the plans and parts lists available here:

The final part is the laser cut acrylic cabinets. We recommend ordering from [Ponoko](http://www.ponoko.com). They allow you to upload svg files and have materials laser cut. Our design, available [here](https://raw.github.com/olcf/tinytitan/master/images/tinytitan_p3_inkscape_fixed.svg), is an upright cabinet version of this [excellent Raspberry Pi Enclosure](http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:25100) by [builttospec](http://www.thingiverse.com/builttospec), and is likewise available under the [CC BY-SA 3.0](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0).
