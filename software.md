**NOTE:** This is a work in progress

<hr />

These are the steps necessary to get your Raspberry Pis talking to each other on
a network using MPI.

### Requirements

- Raspberry Pis running the Raspbian distribution
- A network router or switch to connect the Pis to

### Installation Steps

1. The first step is to power up each Pi and get Rasbian installed on the
   sdcard. Follow the [NOOBS Setup Guide](http://www.raspberrypi.org/help/noobs-setup/)
   for instructions.

2. Once you have Raspian running on each Pi you'll need to login to it either
   directly with a keyboard, mouse, and monitor or remotely over ssh.
