The following covers the asembly of the original TinyTitan case. We are currently in the process of moving to a much easier to assemble case that works with the RaspberryPi B+. Please note that the LED pictured attached to each RaspberryPi is no longer recomended and can be disregarded.

## Step 1
Carefully remove the acrylic components required for a single TinyTitan cabinet from the laser cut sheet. Each piece is covered in protective paper.

## Step 2
The following hardware will be neccessary for assembly:

- 12 18-8 M3-0.5 screws
- 12 M3-0.5 hex nuts
- 1 M3 allen wrench

Also note the optional 15 light pipes

## Step 3
Carefully remove the protective paper from each acrylic piece.

## Step 4
Locate the USB facing acrylic plate and place the USB port of each Pi through it.

## Step 5
It is helpful to construct a small jig to raise the structure a few inches. The following was constructed out of old CD cases and index cards but anything you have handy will work. Disregard to extranious LEDs attached to each Pi.

## Step 6
Locate the 3 platform pieces and insert the 15 light pipes as shown.

## Step 7
Carefully fit the 3 pieces constructed above into the acrylic side. The correct acrylic side will have cutouts for the light pipes.

## Step 8
Rotate the entire structure from <b>Step 7</b> onto the structure from <b>Step 5</b>. Initially do you worry about fitting the tabs into the appropriate slot.

## Step 9
Carefully align each tab and slot.

## Step 10
Locate the three support pieces and top as shown.

## Step 11
Orient the 3 support pieces as shown. The top of the cabinet(the right-most vertical piece of acrylic) does not have to be included yet.

## Step 12
Locate the acrylic plate with a slot cut out for each SD card and loosely place it on the structure.

## Step 13
Line up each tab and slot on the SD card facing side.
![image 14](http://tinytitan.github.io/images/Construction-v1/image14.jpg)
The left most piece as shown should be removed for the time being.

## Step 14
Inserting the nuts can be tricky so the following will aid in construction. Remove one of the thin acrylic strips left over from the original acrylic sheet and wrap it in electrical tape sticky side out. This allows the small nuts to be stuck to the tape as such.

## Step 15
Carefully insert the 6 nuts and 6 bolts as shown below, loosely tighten them just enough to stay in place. <b>DO NOT</b> over tighten the bolts.

## Step 16
Carefully flip the enclosure over to the USB facing side, making sure to keep the enclosure aligned.

## Step 17
Insert each of the 6 nuts and bolts as was done on the previous side. Again, do not tighten the bolts.

## Step 18
Locate the side with the HDMI cutout and carefully put it in place.

## Step 19
Carefully insert the top of the enclosure without distrupting the other pieces.
![image 30](http://tinytitan.github.io/images/Construction-v1/image30.jpg)

## Step 20
Carefully snug up each bolt, too much torque can crack the acrylic.

## Step 21
Congratulations, you're finished!
