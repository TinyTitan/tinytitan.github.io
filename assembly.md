The following covers the asembly of the original TinyTitan case. We are currently in the process of moving to a much easier to assemble case that works with the RaspberryPi B+. Please note that the LED pictured attached to each RaspberryPi is no longer recomended and can be disregarded.

## Step 1
Carefully remove the acrylic components required for a single TinyTitan cabinet from the laser cut sheet. Each piece is covered in protective paper.

## Step 2
The following hardware will be neccessary for assembly:

- 12 18-8 M3-0.5 screws
- 12 M3-0.5 hex nuts
- 1 M3 allen wrench

Also note the optional 15 light pipes

## Step 3
Carefully remove the protective paper from each acrylic piece.

## Step 4
Locate the USB facing acrylic plate and place the USB port of each Pi through it.

## Step 5
It is helpful to construct a small jig to raise the structure a few inches. The following was constructed out of old CD cases and index cards but anything you have handy will work. Disregard to extranious LEDs attached to each Pi.

## Step 6
Locate the 3 platform pieces and insert the 15 light pipes as shown.

## Step 7
Carefully fit the 3 pieces constructed above into the acrylic side. The acrylic side will have cutouts for the light pipes.
